\title{Dataset retrievd from movie previously published in Moreno-Gamez et al., 2017 \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29021534}{pubMED}. Competence is induced with CSP and ssbB-GFP is expressed. The timeing between cells differs slightly. Cells are tracked using SuperSegger.}
\format{A data frame with columns:
\describe{
 \item{node}{the number of the node in the genealogy tree}
 \item{birth}{birthframe of this cell}
 \item{cell}{cell identifier. unique per frame.}
 \item{death}{death frame (or frame the cell divides) of this cell}
 \item{edgelength}{the time (in frames) of the cell division}
 \item{fluorsum}{the sum of the total fluorescence inside the cell. inherited from SuperSegger (see \code{\href{https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger/wiki}{the SuperSegger Wiki}} for more information)}
 \item{fluormean}{the mean of the total fluorescence inside the cell. inherited from SuperSegger (see \code{\href{https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger/wiki}{the SuperSegger Wiki}} for more information)}
 \item{fluorsum_D}{the sum of the fluorescence at cell division. inherited from SuperSegger (see \code{\href{https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger/wiki}{the SuperSegger Wiki}} for more information)}
 \item{fluormean_D}{the mean of the total fluorescence at cell division. inherited from SuperSegger (see \code{\href{https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger/wiki}{the SuperSegger Wiki}} for more information)}
 \item{parent}{the node of the parent of this cell}
 \item{child1}{the cell number of the daughter cell of this cell}
 \item{child2}{the cell number of the other daughter cell of this cell}
 \item{root}{the root of the genealogy tree. by default, this is 0.}
 \item{nodelabel}{the cell number corresponding to the node}
