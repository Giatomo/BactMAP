\title{Dataset retrievd from movie previously published in Moreno-Gamez et al., 2017 \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29021534}{pubMED}. Competence is induced with CSP and ssbB-GFP is expressed. The timeing between cells differs slightly. Cells are tracked using SuperSegger.}
\format{A phylo object containing the genealogy information of this timelapse movie.
\describe{
Phylogenetic tree with 103 tips and 95 internal nodes.
