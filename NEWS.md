### Version 0.1.0.0

This is the first official version of BactMAP. For those who have been using the development versions for a while, there are a few changes:

1. Naming consistencies: *createPlotlist* was changed into *createPlotList* ; *plottreebasic* to *plotTreeBasic*.
2. All *extr*-functions now have a **_** (underscore) behind *extr*, instead of a **.** (dot).
3. The amount of dependencies for *BactMAP* grew. If it is not possible to immediately install *ggtree* during installation of *BactMAP*, manually install it via *BiocManager*. I'm working on a solution to make this package not mandatory.
4. Find a full manual, including tutorials, on https://github.com/vrrenske/BactMAP/wiki
5. Please report any issues on https://github.com/vrrenske/BactMAP/issues.
